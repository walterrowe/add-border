	* File Format: Application

### To use inside Capture One

1. Go to `Open With` field in a Capture One Output Recipe
2. Choose `Other` from the `Open With` drop-down menu
3. Navigate to and select your add_border droplet
4. Select Process Recipe
5. Select images to process
6. Process images (`CMD-d`)

### macOS Catalina Considerations

macOS Catalina introduces new levels of security to protect your system from unwanted access to your files. This change requires that you to grant explicit access to your files and folders. The add_border droplet uses the Image Event core service to modify the border of the selected image files. We therefore need to grant Full Disk access to the Image Event service so it can read and write your image files.

This information was documented in [this article](https://darjeelingsteve.com/articles/Fixing-%22Image-Events%22-AppleScripts-Broken-in-macOS-10.15-Catalina.html) written by Steve Anthony.

1. Open System Preferences
2. Go to Security & Privacy
3. Click the Lock icon to unlock the panel
4. Click the Privacy tab at the top
5. Scroll down to and select Full Disk Access
6. In the right side click the "+" button
7. In the navigator popup, select the following:
	* Macintosh HD > System > Library > CoreServices > Image Events
8. Press the Open button in the bottom right corner

This should add the Image Events service to the list of apps with Full Disk Access permissions.

### To use directly in macOS Finder

1. Select image files in Finder
2. Drag-n-drop onto add_border droplet

### Origins

This script originates from Appleâ€™s Recursive Image File Processing Droplet template. You can read more about it in the [Mac Automation Scripting Guide to Process Dropped Files and Folders](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/ProcessDroppedFilesandFolders.html). It formats and executes terminal `sips` command to edit the selected image files.
1. Open Apple ScriptEditor
2. Navigate to menu option File > New from Template > Droplets > Recursive Image File Processing Droplet
